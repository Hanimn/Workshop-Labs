# RAG Pipeline for Cyber Threat Intelligence - Complete Project Plan

## Project Overview

This hands-on lab builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that ingests curated Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data, creates an embedding index, and answers investigative questions using a large language model. The goal is to demonstrate how RAG can ground LLM outputs with CTI to reduce hallucination and support detection engineering and incident response.

## How the System Works

### Core Architecture
The RAG pipeline combines traditional information retrieval with modern language models to provide accurate, source-grounded responses to cybersecurity questions. Instead of relying solely on an LLM's pre-trained knowledge (which can be outdated or incomplete for rapidly evolving threats), the system retrieves relevant, up-to-date threat intelligence from a curated knowledge base before generating responses.

### Technical Components

**1. Data Ingestion Layer**
- Connects to multiple CTI sources (STIX/TAXII feeds, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE databases)
- Parses structured threat data (IOCs, TTPs, vulnerabilities, attack patterns)
- Normalizes data into consistent format for processing
- Handles real-time feed updates and data versioning

**2. Knowledge Processing**
- Chunks CTI documents into semantically meaningful segments
- Generates vector embeddings using cybersecurity-optimized models
- Stores embeddings in vector database with rich metadata (threat actor, campaign, MITRE techniques)
- Preserves source attribution and data lineage

**3. Retrieval System**
- Takes investigative questions as input
- Performs semantic search across the CTI knowledge base
- Ranks results by relevance, recency, and threat severity
- Filters by threat type, geographic region, or specific campaigns
- Implements hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching

**4. Generation Layer**
- Combines retrieved CTI context with user query
- Uses prompt engineering to ensure grounded responses
- Generates answers with proper source attribution
- Validates responses against retrieved evidence
- Implements fact-checking mechanisms

### Key Advantages

**Accuracy**: Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in verified threat intelligence
**Currency**: Provides up-to-date information from live threat feeds
**Traceability**: Every response includes source attribution for verification
**Contextual**: Understands cybersecurity domain-specific terminology and relationships

## Practical Use Cases

### Incident Response
**Query**: "What TTPs are associated with APT29 targeting healthcare organizations?"
**Process**: Retrieves latest reports about APT29, filters for healthcare sector, provides current attack patterns with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and IOCs.

### Threat Hunting
**Query**: "Show me recent malware families using PowerShell for persistence mechanisms"
**Process**: Searches across malware reports, identifies PowerShell-based persistence techniques, returns families with behavioral indicators and detection rules.

### Attribution Analysis
**Query**: "What evidence links IP address 192.168.1.100 to known threat actors?"
**Process**: Correlates IP across multiple intelligence sources, identifies associated infrastructure, provides attribution confidence levels with supporting evidence.

### Vulnerability Assessment
**Query**: "What exploits are available for CVE-2024-1234 and which threat groups are using them?"
**Process**: Retrieves exploit information, maps to threat actor TTPs, provides exploitation timeline and defensive recommendations.
